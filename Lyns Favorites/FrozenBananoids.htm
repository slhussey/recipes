<p style="font-weight: bold;">Frozen Bananoids</p>
<p>You probably couldn't survive on these alone, but it would be fun trying.</p>
<hr>
<p>&frac12; bag (12 oz) chocolate chips</p>
<p>&frac14; cup milk</p>
<p>&frac12; bag (7 oz) coconut</p>
<p>1 cup chopped walnuts</p>
<p>4-5 bananas</p>
<p>tongs</p>
<p>double boiler</p>
<p>2 paper plates</p>
<p>waxed paper</p>
<p>2 bowls</p>
<hr>
<p>A double boiler is just a pan-inside-a-pan kind of thing that is useful for melting chocolate. Making this recipe without one is tough since chocolate is awfully easy to burn. Ask your assistant for some help in finding and using one.</p>
<p>Put a cup or cup-and-a-half of water in the bottom pan of your double boiler then put the top pan on.</p>
<p>Put the chocolate and milk in the top part, turn the heat on low and stir a lot. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until the chocolate is all melted. Then get your assistant to remove it and set it aside to cool a bit.</p>
<p>Put the chopped walnuts in one bowl and the coconut in another. (If you didn't get the already chopped kind, chopping the walnuts is probably grown-up work.) You'll have to lossen the coconut up a bit with a fork - it's kind of clumpy.</p>
<p>Put a big pice of waxed papaer on the table and a smaller piece on each paper plate.</p>
<p>Now the gooey part. Peel one banana, cut it in thirds and use you tongs or a fork to dip it in the chocolate. Make sure it's all covered, then roll it around in the nuts or coconut (or both).</p>
<p>You now have a bananoid. Set it on the wax paper covered paper plate and start again (peel your bananas one at a time). This recipe fills about 2 plates. Put the filled plates in the freezer and wait as long as you can stand it.</p>
