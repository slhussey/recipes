<p style="font-weight: bold;">Fresh Fruit with Almond Cream</p>
<p>Yield: 8 servings of &frac12; cup each</p>
<p>Source: Adapted from Cooking Light Cookbook, 1988, pg 230, Oxmoor House, Birmingham, AL</p>
<hr>
<p>4 oz lowfat cream cheese</p>
<p>2 Tbsp honey</p>
<p>1 Tbsp skim milk</p>
<p>1 tsp almond extract</p>
<p>1 cup bananas, sliced</p>
<p>1 cup blueberries</p>
<p>1 cup strawberries, quartered</p>
<p>1 cup kiwi fruit, chunked</p>
<hr>
<p>Combine the cream cheese, honey, skim milk, and almond extract. Process until smooth. Cover and chill while preparing the fruits.</p>
<p>Rinse the blueberries and strawberries under cold running water before preparing them for the salad. Drain and set on paper towel. Place the blueberries into a medium bowl. Cut the strawberries into quarters and place in the bowl with the blueberries. Peel the kiwi fruit and then cut into chunks; add the chunks to the bowl with the other fruits. Finally, slice the banana into the bowl and toss lightly to combine.</p>
<p>Spoon the fruit mixture into individual serving bowls. Top each serving of fruit with 1 Tbsp of the chilled almond cream cheese mixture and then garnish with fresh mint leaf. Serve immediately.</p>
<p>Note: You can use any combination of fresh fruits. Try sliced peaches, raspberries, plums and papaya. Experiment with cantaloupe, honeydew, strawberries and red seedless grapes.</p>
