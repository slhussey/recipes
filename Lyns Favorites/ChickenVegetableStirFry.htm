<p style="font-weight: bold;">Chicken and Vegetable Stir Fry</p>
<p>Yield: Serves 4</p>
<p>Source: Home Recipe, 1997</p>
<hr>
<p>Cooking spray</p>
<p>1 Tbsp vegetable oil</p>
<p>1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts</p>
<p>2 carrots, peeled, thin diagonal cuts</p>
<p>&frac12; red pepper, cut into thin strips</p>
<p>&frac12; cup zucchini, cut in half longwise, diagonal cut</p>
<p>&frac12; cup yellow squash, cut in half longwise, diagonal cut</p>
<p>&frac12; cup snow peas, trimmed</p>
<p>2 Tbsp stir-fry sauce</p>
<p>1 Tbsp mirin</p>
<p></p>
<p>1 cup long grain white rice</p>
<p>3 cups water</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align: left;">Preparing the Rice:</p>
<p>Measure the water andplace it in a 2-quart heavy saucepan. Place the pan over high heat on the stove. Bring the water to a boil. Stir the rice into the boiling water and reduce the heat to low and cover. Allow to cook over low heat for 15 minutes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Preparing the Stir-Fry:</p>
<p>Rinse the chicken breasts under cold running water. Using a red cutting board, cut the chicken into thin strips. (Having the chicken semi-frozen makes it easier to slice the chicken into strips.) Set aside until ready to cook.</p>
<p>Wash all the vegetables under cold running water before prepping them using a green cutting board. Once they are all cut, put them into separate mounds on the green cutting board so that they are ready for cooking.</p>
<p>Spray the wok (or large skillet) with cooking spray and add 1 Tbsp vegetable oil. Place the wok over high heat. When the wok is hot add the chichen and stir fry until it is lightly browned. Push the chicken to the sides of the wok and start adding the vegetables. Start with the carrots and red pepper, saut&eacute; for another 2 minutes. Add the zucchini, yellow squash and snow peas, saut&eacute; for another 2 minutes. Measure the stir-fry sauce and mirin into a small bowl and stir to combine. Pour into the bottom of the wok, then stir to combine with the meat and vegetables. Heat through and serve over cooked rice.</p>
