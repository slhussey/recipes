<p style="font-weight: bold;">Karl Zerangue's Cajun Dirty Rice</p>
<p>Source: Adapted from <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mjw/ethnic/cajun/dirty-rice-1.html">Recipe Archive</a></p>
<p>Various recipes for this popular dish include lots of different ingredients, such as chicken liver, sausage, endouille, etc. But my Mom's recipe is of course my favorite and quite simple.  The following is a close estimate (since no one has ever written down the actual amounts of any ingredients - until now!).</p>
<hr>
<p>1 lb. ground pork</p>
<p>1 lb. ground beef</p>
<p>1 large bell pepper</p>
<p>1 medium onion</p>
<p>5 - 6 peeled cloves of garlic</p>
<p>1 or 2 fresh, green cayenne peppers (if available)</p>
<p>1 tsp. salt (use to own taste)</p>
<p>1 tsp. red pepper (use to own taste -- balance with fresh pepper above)</p>
<p>2 cans mushroom steak sauce (NOT soup, usual brand I find here is Dawn's; 1 can = about 4-6 oz.)</p>
<p>3-4 cups cooked rice ( not real sure about this amout)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Dressing Mix:</p>
<p>Pan fry the ground meat well until all of the meat is well done. Put bell pepper, onion and garlic into food processor and "nearly" liquify it, then add this to the meat.  The pepper/onion/garlic should sizzle as you stir it well into the the meat.  When the sizzling fades, add the mushroom steak 
sauce and a little water and allow the entire dressing mix to simmer for at least a half hour.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Dirty Rice:</p>
<p>Cooked rice can be added to this mixure and thoroughly stirred.  The more rice you add, the drier and "whiter" the resulting dressing will be.  Adding the right amount of rice will result in a dressing that is moist with the rice appearing very brown ("dirty").</p>
